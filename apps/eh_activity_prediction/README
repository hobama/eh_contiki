Activity prediction for energy harvesting
=========================================
This application predicts the maximum allowed energy that a node
that uses energy harvesting can consume in the next time slot, such
that the node's utility is maximised and the node does not deplete
its energy.

The algorithm calculates the energy consumption for the next slot
using the law of energy conservation, such that
E_next = E_crt + E_harv - E_cons
The algorithm tries to keep the energy of the system at a set level,
which should be defined as the maximum level. This will allow
optimal utility assignment.
