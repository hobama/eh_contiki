Energy harvester simulation
===========================

This is a simulator for energy harvesting that receives 
values representing harvested energy over the serial line.
To allow synchronisation between the "outside world" and
ourselves, we poll the outside periodically.

The application works together with the battery simulator
to add energy to the battery.

It also generates an event with each new incoming energy
value.
